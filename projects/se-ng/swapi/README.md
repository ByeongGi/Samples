# Swapi

This is a helper project to be able to use the [Star Wars API ](https://swapi.co/) in my Angular samples.
It getches the entirety of swapi and cases this into indexedDB by utilizing [idb-keyval](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval) from Jake Archibald.
This library is part of [Sanders Samples repo.](https://github.com/SanderElias/Samples)

to use the library do:
```bash
yarn add @se-ng/swapi idb-keyval
```



This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.
